# Kanagana

**Kanagana** is a lightweight Japanese study tool designed for beginners to practice **Hiragana** and **Katakana**. Built with React, the app provides a simple, intuitive interface to test your recognition and typing skills using randomized characters and words.

## 🌸 Features

- 🔤 **Hiragana Practice**  
  Test your ability to identify Hiragana characters by typing their correct **romaji** equivalents.

- 🈂️ **Katakana Practice**  
  A random Katakana **word** is shown. Type the **hiragana** translation using a built-in keyboard that converts romaji to hiragana in real time.

- 🌱 Beginner-friendly and distraction-free layout
- 💻 Responsive design (mobile support coming soon)
